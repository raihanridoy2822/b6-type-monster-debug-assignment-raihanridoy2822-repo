    <h3>question 1: Difference between local storage and session storage</h3>
    <p>
        sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire,
        data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab
        in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab
    </p>
    <h3>question2:How to work javascript evenloop </h3>
    <p>
        JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting
        and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other
        languages like C and Java.
    </p>

    <h3>question 3: Difference between global scope and local scope</h3>
    <p>
        Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must
        access, such as a session id. A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block
        that it is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost .
    </p>

    <h3>question 4:Which type undifine we get?</h3>
    <p>
        undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of
        undefined is the primitive value undefined.

        In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the
        case, avoid overriding it.)

        A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined
        if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value
        was not returned.
    </p>
